            <p style="text-align: left">On Cape Cod, fresh ground water 'floats'
              on an underlying bed of sea water. As sea levels rise, so does the
              ground water that many coastal communities depend on for well water.
              We modeled ground water levels based on a 2015 survey of wells and
              septic systems in Wellfleet, MA. Among our findings: six feet of
              sea level rise will cause septic systems in 78 homes will to cease
              operating properly due to ground water incursion. Separately, 65
              wells will be inundated by sea water. A

              2017 NOAA report</a> estimates a 15% probability that sea level
              rise on Cape Cod will exceed four feet by 2050 and less than 1%
              probability that it will exceed ten feet by 2100. Our analysis is
              based on a six foot sea level rise.</p>

          <p style="text-align: left">In the 2020 Presidential election, counties
            with large Latino populations demonstrated consequential increases in
            support for the GOP. These gains undermined the increased support
            Democrats had won among moderate and suburban voters, contributed to
            GOP wins in key battleground states, including Texas and Florida,
            and resulted in a closer election than Democrats had hoped. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left">We analyzed 50 independent variables
            across age, race and ethnicity, education, income, employment,
            healthcare access, and access to technology at the state and county
            level for the ten states with the largest Latino populations. Our
            findings indicate that demographic variables are associated with the
            vote change in the West and Southwest states, and socioeconomic
            variables are associated with the vote change in the Eastern states.
            The difference highlights the heterogeneity of the vote in important
            Latino states, and makes clear that political parties cannot use a
            single strategy for Latino outreach.</p>

            record a way point about every second. To visualize this data, roughly
            15 million waypoints were processed into 2,600 polylines. Select
            attributes for each ride were uploaded and associated with the ride
            coordinates to create a flexible illustration of how riding habits
            changed over the period.  All the processing was completed using ArcPy

          <p style="text-align: left">Oil Sands mines tend to be owned and operated
            by large conglomerates. As part of a much larger organization, production
            volumes and operational details fall below the threshold for regulatory
            filings. In this analysis, I use satellite imagery to measure changes in
            mine footprints since the price of oil collapsed in 2014. Click on the

            to compare changes in operational footprint of oils sands mining since
            the 2014 collapse of oil prices. By using part of the visible spectrum
            and sections of the near infrared spectrum - which are not visible to
            humans - areas of open mine and tailing ponds are easily differentiated
            from the surrounding boreal grasslands.</p>

            gas and coal reserves. Reserves are the fossil fuel industry's inventory:
            hydrocarbon deposits that companies own but have not yet been extracted.
            I provided the commentary and underlying research for several editions of

            companies holding the largest fossil fuel reserves. The lists were
            updated on quarterly and provided a basis for fossil fuel divested
